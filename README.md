This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Moderation

Notes added to public pins are moderated before saving.

- Server route: `POST /api/moderate`
  - Body: `{ "text": string, "languageHint"?: "en" | "hi" }`
  - Response: `{ "allowed": boolean, "reason": string | null }`
- The server calls Google Gemini to classify abusive/hate/sexual/self-harm/violence/illegal/spam/gibberish.
- Client falls back to a lightweight local check if the API fails.

### Environment variables

Set the following in your environment:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
